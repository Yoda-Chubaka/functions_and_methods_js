/*FUNCTION EXPRESSION 
It's less common.
â›”It's impossible to call before initialization - will be error!!
We should use it when this function was created as part of an expression.

/* FUNCTION DECLARATION 
It's more common and easier to read. 
ðŸŸ¢It can be called before initialization - raw #21.
We should use it when this function is separate and standalone in code.

/*ARROW FUNCTION
It's spesial anonimous function to use in context another function or code where it was declared.
It takes a fixed number of arguments.
If it takes only one one argument we don't have to use brackets "()" (raws# 51-53).
If we describe only one action we don't have to use curly brackets "{}" and word "return" (raws #40-45).
If we describe few actions we have to use "{}" and word "return" (raws #47-49).
Variables have block scope.
It can be used as callback function.
